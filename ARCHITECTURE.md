# Architecture

## Overview
This repository describes the architecture of a simple, fast, and scalable website hosted on AWS. In the first iteration, the website will serve static HTML files through an Amazon S3 bucket, with CloudFront used as a CDN for efficient content delivery.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - Stores the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - Configured for public read access to serve content.
   - Cost-effective and highly durable.

### 2. **Amazon CloudFront**
   - A global content delivery network (CDN) to cache content and improve load times.
   - Reduces latency by serving content from edge locations closer to users.
   - Handles SSL/TLS encryption for secure HTTPS access.

### 3. **AWS Route 53 (Optional)**
   - Can be used for custom domain name management.
   - Provides DNS resolution to map domain names to the CloudFront distribution.

## Deployment Workflow
1. **Build static website** – Develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **Upload to S3** – Store files in an S3 bucket configured for public web hosting.
3. **Set up CloudFront** – Distribute content globally and configure caching.
4. **(Optional) Configure Route 53** – Set up a custom domain with DNS records.

## Advantages
- **Fast Performance**: Using CloudFront ensures low latency and fast page loads.
- **Scalability**: S3 and CloudFront automatically handle high traffic.
- **Low Cost**: Pay only for the storage and bandwidth used.
- **Security**: HTTPS support with CloudFront, plus AWS IAM policies for access control.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AWS Lambda@Edge for dynamic personalization.
- Add a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
- Introduce backend APIs using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

### Getting Started
To deploy your static site:
1. Upload your website files to an S3 bucket.
2. Configure the bucket for public access or use an OAC (Origin Access Control) for secure CloudFront access.
3. Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket.
4. (Optional) Link a custom domain with Route 53.
