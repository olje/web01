# Architecture Readme

This document outlines the high-level architecture of our website. The current implementation focuses on delivering fast, scalable, and performant content to users.

## Overview
The architecture is designed with performance and scalability in mind. In this iteration, we're using AWS infrastructure to host static HTML files and deliver them through S3 and CloudFront for optimal performance.

---

### 1. Static Content
- **HTML Files**: Serve as the foundation of our website.
- **CSS Stylesheets**: Define styling for content rendering.
- **JavaScript Files**: Handle client-side interactivity and dynamic features.

These are all static assets, meaning they don't require server-side processing. This ensures fast response times and low resource usage.

---

### 2. Static Hosting
- **S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)**: Used to host the static content.
  - S3 is ideal for this purpose due to its scalability, reliability, and low cost.
  - It allows us to store HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files efficiently.

---

### 3. Edge Caching
- **CloudFront (Amazon CloudFront)**: A global CDN that caches our static content.
  - This ensures fast load times for users located anywhere in the world.
  - Content is cached at the edge locations, reducing latency and improving performance.

---

### 4. Domain Configuration
- The domain will be configured to point to the S3 bucket's hosted zone.
- DNS records will be set up to ensure that all traffic routes through our static content.

---

### 5. Security
- **HTTPS**: Enabled for all connections to ensure secure data transmission.
- **Edge Caching with Amazon CloudFront**: Ensures that sensitive content is cached securely at the edge level.

This architecture provides a lightweight, fast, and scalable way to deliver our website to users. It's designed to handle high traffic and deliver content quickly while minimizing costs.
